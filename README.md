# Final-Paper-on-Diabetes-Dataset
This is a project for my final where I try to evaluate a dataset that involves figuring out if a patient has diabetes or not based on a few different factors. I use the keras model and tensorflow library as I wanted to see how a neural network evaluates a dataset compared to typical machine learning models.
